The goal of occupancy is to be a one stop shop for the latest in Bayesian occupancy modeling. This package allows users to fit and analyze occupancy models in R. 

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of occupancy from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("occupancy") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with: -->
You can install the development version of occupancy from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("StrattonCh/occupancy")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(occupancy)
## basic example code
```

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
